<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository contains a collection of code written for rapidly setting up
and analyzing electronic structure calculations (using DFT and the Gaussian09 
software package) and molecular dynamics simulations (using the Amber 12
molecular dynamics suite).

Most if not all code is written in some combination of Python, Bash, and
Fortran90, with Python preffered. All Bash code should be considered ultimately
temporary.

More detailed workflow to follow.
